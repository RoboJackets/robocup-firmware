<div class="textblock"><p>This guide targets new members looking for a guide on contributing to the project. This guide will focus on the overall picture of effective coding and contributions. It is not intended to be a technical guide.</p>
<h2>Initial Notes</h2>
<p>Contributing to open source presents a unique set of challenges, especially when dealing with large projects. Our project is approximately 50-80k lines of code, and is still very small by some open source standards.</p>
<p>This should not be discouraging, but rather informative. Most initial contributions will be small; it takes time to learn the project structure and any languages and skills each particular project requires. Contributions of any size will be greatly appreciated, and you should have realistic expectations of what a first contribution might be (if you dont believe me, you can look at my first contribution <a href="https://github.com/RoboJackets/robocup-software/commit/6ce98fc0f8d88b6d145700779e126c0f1b99bb92#diff-71a3477f37bd5b20744e292eda2e3fbc">here</a>. It's two lines of 'code'). This guide will help you learn to navigate our code base, and work toward an initial contribution.</p>
<h2>Pull Request Requirements</h2>
<p>With large projects, organization and structure can break down fairly quickly resulting in some bad spaghetti code. We want to avoid this as much as possible. For this reason, every pull request will be reviewed by a more senior member of the team, currently Justin Buchanan. If your request isn't accepted right away, don't take it personally. Often your code may work fine, but there are things you can add or refine. This helps keep our repository clean and will give you valuable experience participating in a code review process.</p>
<h3>Continuous Integration</h3>
<p>Continuous Integration (CI) is a tool to help auto-detect problems before they are merged into the main respository and have a chance to cause problems. Every time you submit a pull request, the CI tool is run and it will assign a passing or failing mark to the request. If the CI fails, you will need to fix the error in your code before the code review. If the reason for the failure isn't obvious or it's a problem in the CI check itself, seek some help.</p>
<h3>Content</h3>
<p>It's important that the content of a pull request be kept clean and small. Pull requests should be less than 1-2k lines of code. The code changes should reflect one and only one topic (e.g do not include two bug fixes in one pull request). Content should generally be kept to code and documentation, binary content, such as images, may be uploaded elsewhere.</p>
<h3>Documentation</h3>
<p>Code should be documented thoroughly. Generally speaking, you won't be here for more than 4(ish) years. Many students will come behind you and will need to use the code you've written.</p>
<p>Each class or file you create should be documented as to what it contains and what purpose it serves.</p>
<p>Each function should have documentation containing it's purpose, what parameters is takes, and what values it returns. Error handling should be described as well: what errors will it produce, and what assumptions it makes regarding the validation the caller performs ahead of time. If relevant, state if the function may block for extended periods of time. If applicable, state if the function is reentrant or accquires and releases locks.</p>
<p>If the overall set of code is complex and new, consider editing or adding to the wiki.</p>
<p>C/C++/Python is documented using doxygen. You can view the guide for writing doxygen comments and documentation <a href="http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/manual/docblocks.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>Text file types that are not supported by doxygen should still be documented using what ever commenting style that format supports.</p>
<h3>Style and Formatting</h3>
<p>In order to keep the code more readable, code should be formatted and styled uniformly. This would be difficult to coordinate across multiple users, so we have a program that automatically restyles the code for you. If you submit a pull request before restyling the code, it will likely fail the CI check. You can auto-format the code by running <code>make pretty</code>. If you have a lot of code, you may have to run this a few times. You can check if the style is passing by running <code>make checkstyle</code>. If there are no errors, then you are good to go. </p>
